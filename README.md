# GarrysMod HammerPlusPlus Installer
A program which helps with both the installation and configuration of Hammer++ for Garry's Mod

This solution uses both [Costura](https://github.com/Fody/Costura) and [Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json).
By default, these libraries will be uninstalled. To re-install them, right-click on 'References', click 'Manage NuGet Packages...',
then click on the 'Restore' button which should appear at the top of the window, then you can compile the program.
